T,integer,104,"Number of time points t = 1,…,T at level 1. Controls length of time series for all variables.",R/generate_dataset.R,Larger T increases file size and runtime.

branching,integer vector or comma separated list,4,"Children per refined node at each splitting level. Length must equal L minus 1. Example for L=3: ""4,3"".",R/make_tree.R,"If refine_prob < 1, not all nodes split, so actual children counts can vary."
refine_prob,"numeric in [0,1]",1.0,"Probability that a node is refined, at each nonterminal level. Implements mixed resolution trees by leaving some nodes as leaves early.",R/make_tree.R,"Set to 1 for fully balanced tree, less than 1 for partial refinement."
graph_type,character enum,grid,Adjacency structure for the ICAR prior at level 1. Options in current code: grid or ring.,R/make_graph.R,"Grid builds a near square lattice with 4 neighbors, ring builds a cyclic chain."
tau_phi,numeric positive,4.0,"ICAR precision parameter for spatial effects φ. Larger values shrink φ toward zero, smaller values create larger spatial variability.",R/sim_icar.R,"Adjacency controls smoothness pattern, tau_phi controls magnitude."
r_size,numeric positive,20,"Negative binomial overdispersion control via kappa_{t,j} ~ Gamma(r_size, r_size). Mean 1, variance 1 / r_size.",R/generate_dataset.R,"Smaller r_size means stronger overdispersion, larger r_size approaches Poisson."
alpha_dir,numeric positive,50,"Dirichlet concentration for split probabilities ω_{t,lj} ~ Dirichlet(alpha_dir * q_{t,lj}). Controls how noisy ω is around q.",R/sim_splits.R,Smaller alpha_dir gives more variable splits across time.
gamma_lambda,"numeric in (0,1]",0.98,"Temporal discount factor governing dynamics of residual risk λ_tilde under discount evolution. Values near 1 produce slow change, smaller values produce faster change.",R/sim_lambda_tilde.R,"In the current generator, mode is discount. gamma=1 makes λ_tilde constant after t=1."
p,integer positive,2,Number of covariates per spatial unit and time point. x is generated as an array T by n1 by p.,R/generate_dataset.R,Must match length of beta_vals.
beta0,numeric,-7.0,Intercept in the log mean model at level 1: log μ includes beta0 + xβ + φ.,R/generate_dataset.R,Adjusts overall incidence level together with exposures.
beta_vals,numeric vector or comma separated list,"0.25, -0.15",Regression coefficients for covariates. Length must equal p.,R/generate_dataset.R,Represented in csv as a single string.
x_sd,numeric positive,1.0,"Standard deviation for covariate generation: x_{t,j,k} ~ Normal(0, x_sd^2).",R/generate_dataset.R,Increase to widen covariate effect variation.
loge_mean,numeric,9.5,"Mean of log exposure: log e_{t,j} ~ Normal(loge_mean, loge_sd^2). So e is log normal.",R/generate_dataset.R,Controls expected exposure magnitude. Interacts with beta0.
loge_sd,numeric nonnegative,0.3,Standard deviation of log exposure for e. Controls exposure heterogeneity.,R/generate_dataset.R,Set to 0 for constant exposures.
zi_prob,"numeric in [0,1)",0.0,"Optional zero inflation misspecification applied after Poisson draw at level 1. With probability zi_prob, y_{t,j} is set to 0.",R/generate_dataset.R,"This is a misspecification switch, not part of the core MSSTNB DGP."
comp_mode,character enum,static,"How the baseline compositions q_{t,lj} evolve over time before drawing ω. Options: static, drift, changepoint.",R/sim_splits.R,Controls time variation in multiscale allocation proportions.
cp_time,integer,0,"Change point time index used when comp_mode is changepoint. If 0, no change point is applied. If positive, change applies for t > cp_time.",R/sim_splits.R,Must satisfy 1 ≤ cp_time < T to have an effect.
cp_strength,numeric positive,1.0,Strength of composition change at the change point. Implemented by spiking one randomly chosen component of q by multiplying it by cp_strength then renormalizing.,R/sim_splits.R,Larger values create a larger regime shift.
q_drift_sd,numeric nonnegative,0.0,"Drift scale for comp_mode drift. Applies multiplicative log normal perturbations to q each time step, then renormalizes.",R/sim_splits.R,Larger values create faster composition drift.
n_rep,integer positive,30,Number of Monte Carlo replicates to generate for this scenario.,scripts/01_generate_all_data.R,Each replicate uses seed_base + rep_id.
seed_base,integer,1000,Base random seed for this scenario. Replicate r uses seed_base + r plus fixed offsets for subcomponents to reduce coupling.,R/generate_dataset.R,Change seed_base to regenerate an independent set of replicates.
